# youtube_network

I have created dash app that visualizes youtube channel connections based on there common geners.

- Python

The libraries that we used in this dashboard are: 

1) pandas (to manipulate the given youtube dataset)
2) dash (to create dashboard app using plotly dash)
3) networkx (to conver the tabluar data into graph representations)
4) dash cytoscape (dash cytoscape is extension module to implement graph based visualization to dashboard)
